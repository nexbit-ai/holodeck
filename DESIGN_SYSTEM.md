# Holodeck Design System

## 1. Color Palette
- **Primary (Brand):** `#b05a36` (Terracotta/Rust). Used for primary buttons, active states, and key headlines.
- **Background (Canvas):** `#f5eedc` (Cream). Used for the main app background to create a warm, non-clinical feel.
- **Foreground (Text):** `#000000` (Black) for body text; `#b05a36` for emphasis headers.
- **Surface (Cards/Panels):** `#ffffff` (White) or slightly lighter cream for distinct sections.

### Color Flexibility
We are **not strictly restricted** to the exact hex values above. Similar gradients and variations of the brand colors are encouraged, especially for:
- Subheadlines and secondary text
- Hover states and subtle accents
- Gradient backgrounds or overlays

**Guideline:** Any color used should feel harmonious with the terracotta/cream palette. Warmer tones (burnt orange, sienna, tan) that relate to the brand identity are acceptable.

## 2. Typography & UI Rules
- **Headlines:** Bold, distinct. Color should alternate between Black and Brand Primary (#b05a36).
- **Buttons:**
    - Primary: Background `#b05a36`, Text White. Rounded corners.
    - Secondary: Border `#b05a36`, Text `#b05a36`, Background Transparent.
- **Layout:**
    - The app should feel "floating" on the Cream background.
    - Use subtle shadows for cards.
