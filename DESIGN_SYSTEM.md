# Nexbit Design System

## 1. Brand Personality (Look & Feel)

Nexbit should feel **modern, premium, and quietly confident** — like a sharp B2B startup product that’s been designed by a top-tier design team.

**Design keywords:**

* Modern + classy
* Warm + trustworthy (never clinical)
* Minimal but not bland
* Crisp spacing, clean hierarchy
* Subtle gradients and premium surfaces

**Avoid:**

* Generic/default UI vibes
* Overly saturated colors
* Loud, neon, or “gaming” aesthetics
* Heavy shadows or overly rounded bubbly UI

---

## 2. Color Palette

### Core Colors

* **Primary (Brand):** `#b05a36` (Terracotta/Rust)

  * Used for primary buttons, active states, key highlights, and emphasis.
* **Background (Canvas):** `#f5eedc` (Cream)

  * Used for the main app background to create a warm, non-clinical feel.
* **Foreground (Text):** `#000000` (Black)

  * Body text and most UI labels.
* **Surface (Cards/Panels):** `#ffffff` (White)

  * Primary card and panel backgrounds.

### Color Flexibility

We are **not strictly restricted** to the exact hex values above. Similar gradients and variations of the brand colors are encouraged, especially for:

* Subheadlines and secondary text
* Hover states and subtle accents
* Gradient backgrounds or overlays

**Guideline:** Any color used should feel harmonious with the terracotta/cream palette. Warmer tones (burnt orange, sienna, tan) that relate to the brand identity are acceptable.

---

## 3. Gradients & Accents (Premium Startup Feel)

Gradients should be **subtle, classy, and barely-there** — used like a premium accent rather than a loud effect.

### Gradient Usage

Use gradients for:

* Primary button hover states
* Hero headers
* Card borders (1px “glow” style)
* Highlight backgrounds behind key stats

**Do not** use gradients for:

* Entire large pages
* Large text fills
* Anything that reduces readability

### Recommended Gradient Style

* Warm terracotta → soft tan
* Low contrast, high elegance
* Soft overlays rather than hard transitions

---

## 4. Typography (Brand Language)

### Font Family (Mandatory)

Use **Nata Sans (Google Fonts)** across the entire product.

**Weights to use:**

* Light (for subtle supporting text)
* Regular (for body)
* SemiBold/Bold (for headings and key UI)

**Rule:**

* **Never use default fonts** (system fonts, Arial, Roboto, etc.).
* Keep typography consistent throughout the app.
* Typography should feel deliberate, like a design system — not “random.”

### Typography Tone

* Headlines: strong, clean, and confident
* Body: highly readable, airy, not cramped
* Subtext: light weight, slightly muted, never greyed-out too harshly

---

## 5. Headings & Text Rules

### Headline Styling

* Headlines should be bold and distinct.
* Color should alternate between:

  * **Black** (default)
  * **Brand Primary (#b05a36)** (for emphasis)

### Hierarchy

* Headings must have clear size jumps between levels.
* Do not stack multiple bold lines without breathing room.

### Text Contrast

* Always prioritize readability.
* Avoid ultra-light text on cream backgrounds.

---

## 6. Buttons

### Primary Button

* Background: `#b05a36`
* Text: White
* Rounded corners
* Slight shadow (very subtle)
* Hover: slightly darker terracotta OR gradient shift

### Secondary Button

* Border: `#b05a36`
* Text: `#b05a36`
* Background: Transparent
* Hover: very light terracotta tint

### Button Quality Rules

* Buttons should feel “clickable” but premium.
* Avoid overly thick borders.
* Avoid excessive rounding.

---

## 7. Layout & Spacing

### Core Layout

* The app should feel **floating** on the cream background.
* Use subtle shadows for cards.
* Maintain generous padding in cards and sections.

### Spacing Principles

* Prefer whitespace over lines.
* Use consistent spacing increments.
* Align to a clean grid.

---

## 8. Cards, Panels, and Surfaces

### Surface Style

* Cards should be clean, white, and elevated subtly.
* Corners: rounded, but not overly soft.
* Shadows: soft and diffused (no harsh drop shadows).

### Section Separation

* Prefer background separation (surface vs canvas) over heavy dividers.
* Use subtle 1px borders where needed.

---

## 9. Inputs, Forms, and Controls

### Input Style

* Clean, modern, slightly tall inputs.
* Rounded corners consistent with buttons.
* Default border: subtle warm neutral.
* Focus state: brand-colored ring/border.

### Form Rules

* Labels always visible.
* Clear error states (warm red tones — not harsh).

---

## 10. Icons & Illustrations

### Icons

* Use minimal, modern icons.
* Consistent stroke width.
* Prefer outline icons.

### Illustrations

* If used, keep them minimal and brand-harmonized.
* No cartoonish style.

---

## 11. Shadows & Depth

Shadows should be subtle and premium.

**Rules:**

* Avoid heavy shadows.
* Prefer soft elevation.
* Depth should be used to separate layers, not as decoration.

---

## 12. Motion & Interactions

### Motion Style

* Smooth, modern, minimal.
* Quick transitions.
* No bouncy animations.

### Interaction Quality

* Hover states should always exist for clickable elements.
* Active states should be clear.

---

## 13. Overall UI Quality Rules (Non-Negotiables)

### The UI must always feel:

* Premium
* Modern startup-grade
* Clean and intentional

### The UI must never feel:

* Like a default template
* Like a bootstrap dashboard
* Like a generic admin panel

---

## 14. Design Reference Lens

When in doubt, design decisions should be made through the lens of:

* Best-in-class B2B platforms
* Clean startup design
* Premium, warm minimalism

If something looks “usual,” it should be redesigned until it looks distinct and branded.
